# Hi👋

I'm a **PhD Researcher** in the School of Politics and International Relations and a member of the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) at University College Dublin. 

In my PhD project, I employ computational methods to analyse textual data and identify executive leaders' strategic crisis communication in EU institutions.
