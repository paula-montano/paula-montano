# HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a **PhD researcher** in the School of Politics and International Relations and a member of the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) at University College Dublin. 

In my PhD project, I employ computational methods to analyze textual data and identify elite strategic crisis communication in the EU institutions.
